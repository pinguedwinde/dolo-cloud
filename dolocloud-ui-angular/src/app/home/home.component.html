<p>We love <strong>dolo</strong>. All kinds of <strong>dolo</strong>. And we love being creative with the way we make our <strong>dolo</strong>.</p>

<p>Some <strong>dolo</strong> joints offer a set, finite menu of <strong>dolo</strong> to choose from. At Taco Cloud, we want to share
  the joy of <strong>dolo</strong> creativity with you, allowing you to design your own <strong>dolo</strong> from a palette of fresh
  and delicious ingredients. While we may offer some of our creations for you to try, the real fun
  is when you create your own tortilla-wrapped works of art.</p>

<p>And, even though we love <strong>dolo</strong> and creativity, we prefer to avoid doing complex math. That's why
  all <strong>dolo</strong> are priced modestly at $4.99 each, no matter how many or what ingredients you choose.</p>

<p>Click <a href="design">here</a> to get started on your <strong>dolo</strong> masterpiece!</p>
